# music
A simple site which shows the music I listen to. Live demo hosted [here](https://music.cadenchau.com)

Wanted to experiment with designing UI cards as well as searching and filtering and thought this would be a cool project to weave it all together. The site is static and the songs are stored in a constant variable `songs`. Feel free to deploy your own version but please include credit.
